# Credit Scoring Overview

Credit scoring is a key tool in credit risk management, used to evaluate
the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan.

## Purpose
The main purpose of credit scoring is to:
- Rank borrowers by risk level
- Support lending decisions
- Improve consistency in credit approval

## Typical variables
Common input variables include:
- Income level
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Liquidity ratios
- Credit history indicators

## Model approach
In practice, banks often use:
- Logistic regression
- Scorecard-based models
- Rule-based systems for low-risk cases

## Notes
Credit scoring models are used as decision-support tools rather than
fully automated decision makers.
